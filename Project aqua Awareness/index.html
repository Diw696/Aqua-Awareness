                <h2>How to Avoid Water Pollution</h2>
                <p>Preventing water pollution is critical to ensuring a clean and sustainable water supply for future generations. Some effective ways to reduce water pollution include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reducing Plastic Waste:</strong> Plastic waste often ends up in water bodies, causing pollution and harming marine life. Proper waste management and reducing single-use plastics can help.</li>
                    <li><strong>Eco-Friendly Detergents:</strong> Using biodegradable and non-toxic cleaning products reduces the chemicals that enter our waterways, making it safer for aquatic ecosystems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoiding Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Chemical fertilizers and pesticides can seep into groundwater, causing contamination. Opting for organic farming and natural fertilizers helps maintain water quality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Industrial Waste Treatment:</strong> Industries should treat wastewater before releasing it into water bodies, preventing harmful chemicals from polluting the ecosystem.</li>
